This file contains some sample data plus description to demonstrate the sorting facilities of PKS-Edit.

The following table can be sorted by last column as number descending using a key field definition of "f-3d".
It can be sorted by 2nd column (sign) using a key field definition of "f2"

Number	Element		Sign	[g/cm3]
24		Chromium  	Cr 		51.996
26		Iron 		Fe 		55.847
28		Nickel 		Ni 		58.70
27		Cobalt		Co		58.9332
3		Lithium 	Li		6.941
8		Oxygen		O		15.9994
10		Neon		Ne		20.179


The following table can be sorted by last field as date using a key field definition of "f2D"
Note, that the field separator should be ";" and CSV quoting should be used.

ID;Person;Birthday
1;"Hans Miller";1.3.1983
2;Oscar Meyer;4.12.1988
3;Gabi Schmidt;1.1.1972
4;Hermann Mitterecker;28.2.2000
5;Emilie von Meyern;12.12.1949

The following table can be sorted by time using a key field definition of "f1D". Note, that you need to set the
separator to "|" explicitly.

Message|Time
Everything OK|12:12:12
Out of memory|07:00:02
Copying failed|14:14:00

This is an example of a log file format using backslash quotes. Supported also per option. To sort by timestamp (last field of line), use "f3D",
to sort by error level use (ignore case) "f0i" or for this trivial case simply "i".

This is a sample for data, which can be "clustered" during sorting. To sort the data, set the selection
criteria to "# Address" and check the option "Sort Lines Clustered by Selection Criteria".

You may use the following pattern to sort addresses by city: f0l1. 

# Address
Berlin
Kudamm 22
Gabi Meyer
# Address
Munich
Am Stachus 44
Joseph Huber
# Address
Hamburg
Reeperbahn 88
