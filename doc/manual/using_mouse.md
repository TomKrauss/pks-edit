# Using the Mouse

Actions triggered by the mouse can be configured in PKS-Edit using the [action binding configuration](configuration.md). By default, mouse clicks will 
place the text input caret or navigate hyperlinks (in _markdown wysiwyg display_). Dragging the mouse allows you to select text. Dragging the mouse in a selected
text area allows to move the selected text block to an alternate place in the file. To copy the selected text to a new place, you may drag it at the same
time holding the `Shift` key pressed.

## Using the Mouse Wheel

The mouse wheel can be used by default to scroll in the current window. Using the mouse wheel in combination with the `Shift` key will increase the speed of scrolling.
Using the mouse wheel in combination with the `Control` key will increase / decrease the _zoom factor_ (font size).
